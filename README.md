# Angular2 Beta with Gulp, Typescript, and Express  

This uses SystemJS and a minimally configured gulpfile. This app uses HTML5 location paths.
This app isn't meant to overwhelm you with an intensely complex gulp build system. I tried to be as explicit as possible.
I believe it to be organized well enough for you to create a more robust app.

I have purposefully made this project as THIN on the gulp side as possible as not to overwhelm people. 

It's a supplement to this article:
